## 📖 About mlx-drifting-model

mlx-drifting-model is a simple application designed to help you create new data patterns through a process called generative modeling. It uses a method called "drifting," which allows the model to gradually learn to produce new and useful data based on examples it has seen before.

This tool is made for users who want to explore machine learning without needing complicated programming skills. You can use it to experiment with creating images, sounds, text, or other types of data, depending on what you want to try.
